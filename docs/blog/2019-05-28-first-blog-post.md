## What is NeuroLearn?

NeuroLearn is a mobile app that combines proven learning techniques with modern technology to create an optimal study environment. Our mission is to help learners build better study habits through structured sessions, progress tracking, and intelligent insights.

## Why We Built NeuroLearn

Traditional study methods often lack structure and feedback. Many learners struggle with:
- **Distraction**: Difficulty maintaining focus during study sessions
- **Inconsistency**: Irregular study patterns that don't build lasting habits
- **Lack of Insight**: No visibility into learning patterns and progress
- **Poor Motivation**: No clear progress indicators or achievement milestones

NeuroLearn addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Structured Learning**: 25-minute Pomodoro-style sessions for optimal focus
